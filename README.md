## ü§ñ GitHub Actions Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically update the programming languages statistics displayed on the website:

### Update Top Languages Workflow

The `update-top-languages.yml` workflow fetches and calculates the most used programming languages across all my GitHub repositories.

- **Trigger Schedule**:

  - Runs weekly on Saturdays at 11:00 PM UTC
  - Runs on every push to the main branch
  - Can be manually triggered through the GitHub interface

- **Functionality**:
  - Fetches all repositories using the GitHub API
  - Calculates total bytes of code per language across all repositories
  - Generates a sorted list of languages with their respective usage percentages
  - Updates the `public/top-languages.json` file with the latest data
  - Automatically commits and pushes the changes

This automation ensures that the website always displays up-to-date information about my programming language usage without manual intervention.
